Issues or blockers:
    The original idea was to make this project synch .unity scenes. The difficulty with this
    is that unity reload the editor every time the scene file changes. I decided not to try to
    synch scenes for this reason. This also took out a lot of (overscoped) complexity.

    It is difficult to test the project with just one computer. I alternated between using two
    connections in one open project and using two different versions of the editor so as to be 
    able to have multiple instances at a time. Testing has been done between different ips, 
    however not as much as would be optimal.
   
Performance Impact:
    I did not test the performance of this application yet. I would put this task under 
    Issues/Blockers because I don't yet know how to go about accurately testing performance
    in engine. This would also require testing with a large number of connections which in
    itself is another difficult task.

Modularity:
    The client and server are very tightly coupled, however it is not difficult to add to the
    type of data that is passed between them. I would say that the editor windows are very modular
    because they serve only as aids to use existing functions.

Would I Use It?
    At its current state, no. That being said, I do enjoy the project itself and would like to
    make it usable in the future. In terms of usability, scaling back from changing the Unity 
    project to just displaying where other developers are within their own instance of the project
    reduces risks of corrupting work and simply adds better cues as to who is working on what. At
    bare minimum, I really like the message feature and would like to expand upon that because I 
    think being able to send messages to other people from within engine would improve workflow.
