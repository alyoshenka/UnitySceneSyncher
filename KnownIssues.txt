Known Issues and Inconveniences 

Note: this was built using Unity 2019.2.11f1 and has not been extensively tested with other releases

Slow update from inspector to server to display
    Most updates are done in OnInspectorUpdate. This happens 10 times per second and therefore
    results in choppy behavior

Very precise file structure needed for setup

Poor indication of server declining connection
    Message is given upon successful server connection, but not if the server declines or the   
    connection was otherwise successful

Tendency for disconnection to do IdleTimeout
    This typically happens on first trying to connect and then does not happen after, however
    it is still annoying

Display window only updates on mouse over
    Display updates OnGUI, ultimately this would update whenever a server update is recieved

More robust testing should be done
